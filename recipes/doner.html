    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Doner kebab (doner kebap in Turkish) literally means "rotating grilled meat" (any type of meat applies). They were first developed in Bursa. Authentic Turkish doner is made with bread, salad and meat from lamb; regardless, mostly beef or a mix of beef and lamb is used in Europe. Although frozen kebab is available at convenience stores, they don't match fresh home-made kebab and may not be consistent with your taste and spicing. This article has the recipe for a complete European-style pita kebab. In Azerbaijani it is pronounced as doner. </p>
